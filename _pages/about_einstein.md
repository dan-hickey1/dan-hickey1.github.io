I am a first-year PhD Student in the [School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [David Bamman](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/). My research interests are in computational social science and natural language processing, with an emphasis on studying online harms such as hate speech and misinformation. Currently, I am interested in understanding public discourse about scholarly work and how to mitigate the spread of misinformation about science. During my undergraduate years, I researched online hate communities, studying topics such as how language diffuses among different types of hate communities or how effective counterspeech is at driving users away from hate communities.

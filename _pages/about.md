I am a first-year PhD Student in the [School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [David Bamman](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/). My research interests are in computational social science and natural language processing, with an emphasis on studying online harms such as hate speech and misinformation. Currently, I am interested in understanding public discourse about scholarly work and how to mitigate the spread of misinformation about science. 

During my undergraduate years, I researched online hate communities, studying topics such as how language diffuses among different types of hate communities or how effective counterspeech is at driving users away from hate communities. You can find a more detailed history of my previous experience in my [CV](https://dan-hickey1.github.io/assets/pdf/hickey_cv_11_24.pdf).

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and writing reviews on [traderjoesreviews.com](https://www.traderjoesreviews.com/).
